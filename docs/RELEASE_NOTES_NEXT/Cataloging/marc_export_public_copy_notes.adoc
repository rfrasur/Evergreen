== marc_export Exports Public Copy Notes and Copy Tags ==

Public copy notes and tags are now exported by `marc_export` in the
852 subfield z when the `--items` option is used.

Copy tags come before copy notes, and tags with a URL come before
those without.  The URL of a copy tag (if any) is added to 852
subfield u.  The copy tags are ordered such that the first subfield z
should correspond to the first subfield u and so on if there is more
than one URL.
