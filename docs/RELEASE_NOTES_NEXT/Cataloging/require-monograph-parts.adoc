== Option to Require Monograph Parts ==

The Require Monographic Part when Present Library Setting,
`circ.holds.ui_require_monographic_part_when_present`, has been
expanded to also require that all copies on the parent bibliographic
record have a part when the setting is active.

This setting requires a patron to select a monograph part when placing
a hold if any parts exist on the bibliographic record.  In a logical
extension of this behavior, the setting now also requires catalogers
to use parts on all copies when any copy at the library have parts.

The change in behavior only affects the library/organization unit
where the setting is set or its sub-units.
